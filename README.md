## Description

### Inspiration

With the internet’s increasing influence on people’s lives, the internet has changed the fundamental nature in which we communicate and consume information.

Although there is a vast amount of information available with just an internet connection, there are many problems we face when interacting with news online. Some of these include too much information, irresponsible headlines/reporting, and a lack of ways to act on the information you read. **This is a particularly big issue when it comes to reporting on mental health and suicide.** Studies have shown that the way we talk about suicide publicly can have astounding consequences. 

### How it works

TakeAction is a google chrome extension that analyzes a webpage the user is currently on. Machine learning is then used to analyze the content of the webpage and detect if there is unethical or misleading reporting regarding mental health or suicide. If it is detected, articles are provided to the user to explain the misunderstood aspects of mental illness that are often exacerbated by the media.

The extension also offers trusted organizations that the user can truly take action by donating to. Thus, our solution works in two ways: spreading awareness for mental health and the truth about suicide, and then bringing real change.
